          <p>
            In the two priority modes you gain control over either the aperture or
            the shutter speed and the camera will automatically choose the other.
            This means that in one mode you can decide the shutter speed to fit if
            your motive is still or fast moving or perhaps if you wish to add
            motion blur to your image while in the other mode you can adjust the
            aperture thus controlling the depth of field (bokeh) and let the
            camera decide on the shutter speed.Â  These modes are great for fast
            photography, where you still want to retain control over one essential
            setting.
